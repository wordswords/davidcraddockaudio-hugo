I have a strong music and sound engineering technical element to my skillset, having built several novel DJ set-ups, several music studio builds, including dealing with acoustic challenges, digital streaming challenges, and have built my own modular synthesisers which included extensive research.

My career in IT, software and as a technologist heavily intersects with this, for example: I spent 6 months in BBC R&D's music department working on modelling binaural acoustic research algorithms. I also worked for several years on iPlayer, including some exposure to streaming technologies and broadcast engineering.

I am an experienced studio technician with good understanding of OBS, Streamlabs OBS, lighting, MIDI, streaming cameras, balanced and unbalanced audio, ethernet and wireless netwoking, wiring patchbays, cable ties, rack equipment, configuring controllers, DMX lighting, maintaining older synths and building out Eurorack synthesizers.

## Testimonials

I was employed as a freelance consultant to design, assemble and support a professional guitar tutors streaming setup. This is what he had to say about what I did:

    “I had to quickly adapt my business to function online only, with very little relevant experience. David provided me with setup and purchase advice, installation help and was available for further consultation whenever I needed him. He was a pleasure to work with and really knows his stuff. I’d highly recommend his services.” – Jon Hatton, Guitar tutor.
