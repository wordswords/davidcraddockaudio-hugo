## Music Education

In tandem with decades of professional experience in DJing and production, I'm a firm believer in life-long music education, and have complimented my music work with a lot of formal and informal music education:

* I have studied 5 modules in music production and sound engineering focused on DJing and electronic music, one at [Canterbury College)[https://www.canterburycollege.ac.uk], one at [Manchester School of Electronic Music Manchester](https://schoolofelectronicmusic.com/home/), and three of which have been at the internationally recognised music school: [Point Blank Music School](https://www.pointblankmusicschool.com).
* I have also undertaken extensive self-study around [DJing](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/22437975?shelf=djing), [Sound Design, Sound Synthesis and Modular Synthesisers](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/22437975-david?shelf=music-production).
* I have undertaken several 1-2-1 DJ lessons with a hugely experienced alternative music DJ icon and producer over the process of several months.
