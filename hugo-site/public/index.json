[{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted an arcade machine in my home. But I could never really afford one, in terms of time and space.\nRecently I thought to myself, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m 42, I\u0026rsquo;m not getting any younger\u0026rdquo;. So I built an arcade setup using the things I already had in the home.\nSoftware Playnite I use PlayNite as the \u0026lsquo;hub\u0026rsquo; where I access all my games, arcade, retro or modern. PlayNite is - hands down - one of the best piece of open source software I\u0026rsquo;ve ever seen, let alone used for gaming specifically.\nI have a setup which automatically downloads from Youtube a trailer for each game and ROM I have, so you can see the game in action before playing it.\nRetroArch For emulation, I use RetroArch under PlayNite. I put off moving to RetroArch for some time and struggled with using individual emulators, but I should have just gone with it from the start. Now I know how to use it, it\u0026rsquo;s the best tool for what I want to do - which is emulate many games on dozens of different systems. I just have to configure the controllers for RetroArch ONCE and it will map them fairly easily onto each individual emulator core, which is very very handy!\nFBNeo RetroArch Core The FBNeo RetroArch Core is essentially an arcade machine emulator. It will emulate most types of arcade board prior to 2012 or so, including the Neo Geo AES, which is the one most of my ROMs are based around.\nGames The ROMs I have are all stored on my file server upstairs. I can get around a 3gbits/sec connection via my 10gbits/sec home network, so there is no performance \u0026lsquo;hit\u0026rsquo; in streaming them off the network drive - it has similar latency to a physical drive. Which is handy, because my ROM collection is too big for the storage on my gaming PC.\nHardware Arcade Sticks I use two Arcade Sticks that I\u0026rsquo;ve had for a while to control the arcade games. Both have 8-way directional joysticks and at least 6 arcade style buttons.\nMayflash Arcade Stick F300 Elite This is the arcade stick that I generally use as it\u0026rsquo;s the better of the two. It has genuine Swarma arcade buttons and a joystick, which makes the arcade experience more like a \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; arcade machine\nDatel Arcade Pro Joystick This is the \u0026lsquo;guest\u0026rsquo; arcade stick. It is a fairly cheap but functional arcade stick.\nSinden Light-Gun (Black) with recoil This is the light-gun that I use most of the time, as it\u0026rsquo;s the more expensive one with recoil. It is from SindenLightgun.com and works very well with all types of screens I\u0026rsquo;ve tested it on, at all angles.\nSinden Light-Gun (Red) This is the \u0026lsquo;guest\u0026rsquo; light gun for 2 player light-gun games.\nWireless keyboard and Mouse So that I can control things easier from just the standing position at the arcade table, I am using a cheap bluetooth keyboard and mouse for any config needed for the emulators, etc.\nAudio and Visual TV This is a 40\u0026quot; Sony TV which is 1080p and I bought it I think in 2015. The picture is still good. It is connected to my gaming PC.\nGoogle Home Routine When I say \u0026lsquo;Hey google arcade\u0026rsquo; to my Google Home Mini voice assistant, it configures the smart devices and plugs in the \u0026lsquo;Dave Cave\u0026rsquo; so that it is optimal for arcade gaming, e.g. - it turns off the lights, turns off all the other 3 screens, puts on the lava lamps, and turns on the gaming PC speakers and sub-woofer.\nFurniture I\u0026rsquo;m currently using an old garden table, and a crate, with a black cloth draped over it! Very budget. Maybe at some point I will get a more expensive table, but this setup holds everything at an ergonomic height so you can use the controllers and light guns with the TV at a good distances.\nPossible Improvements I want to add more RetroArch cores so that I can play more than arcade games on the setup - I should be able to play all retro console games too. Although this is not essential at this point.\nI want to add footswitches and configure them so that I can play Time Crisis 2 with the \u0026lsquo;cover\u0026rsquo; switch mechanic.\n","permalink":"https://davidcraddock.games/arcade-setup/","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;ve always wanted an arcade machine in my home.

It was released in arcades in 1997, and later ported to the PlayStation 2 in 2001. It is the second instalment in the Time Crisis series.\nThe game features a two-player mode, where each player takes turns using a light gun to shoot enemies and reload. Players can duck behind cover to avoid enemy fire, and pop out to shoot enemies. The game also features a pedal that players can step on to pop out of cover and shoot enemies.\nI remember playing Time Crisis 2 in arcades when I was a kid. It was one of my favourite games to play with friends. The light gun was so much fun to use, and the pedal added an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay. I also loved the graphics and sound effects, which really added to the immersive experience.\nI recently bought a Sinden Light Gun with recoil to use with my PC via an emulator. I decided to get Time Crisis 2 and set it up to work with it, as I had a lot of fun in the arcades on it.\nI bought a second-hand PS2 Time Crisis 2 disc from ebay, and used the PS2 redump.org dumping guide to dump the PS2 iso for use with the PCSX2 PC PS2 emulator. I could have downloaded the image illegally but I really avoid doing that unless I absolutely have to.\nEven though you can get the Sinden Light Gun to work directly with my physical PS2 console via some hardware hackery, I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to do that, and preferred to use the PCSX2 emulator.\nWhen the Sinden Light Gun arrives, I am intending to get Time Crisis 2 running now on my 42\u0026quot; 1080p screen TV, with the Sinden light gun software working, and a cheap USB pedal for reload.\nI will also use Phillips Hue for lighting in my room so that the Phillips Hue home entertainment system and the lightstrip around my TV matches the colours of the edges of the TV.\nSound will be provided by my 2.1 sound system, EQ\u0026rsquo;d to the characteristics of my room by SonorWorks SoundID.\nIf this setup all works and I am happy with it, I will buy a second light gun and a second cheap USB pedal, for friends and family to play with me on the TV.\n","permalink":"https://davidcraddock.games/time-crisis-2-setup/","summary":"Time Crisis 2 is a light-gun shooter arcade game developed and published by Namco.

Quite positive! Some initial thoughts:\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been a long-time BioWare fan since Baldur\u0026rsquo;s Gate, but was massively disappointed with Mass Effect: Andromeda, so much so that I didn\u0026rsquo;t even bother playing Anthem. I do like the setting and the characterisations in the Dragon Age series, and thought it was worth pre-ordering this game just in case they didn\u0026rsquo;t totally mess it up. Happily - it appears they didn\u0026rsquo;t! As a lot of reviewers have already noted, the game is \u0026ldquo;worlds away\u0026rdquo; from the start of the series in Dragon Age: Origins. This won\u0026rsquo;t please some people. Turn based combat is completely gone. The tone is much more light-hearted and upbeat, there is no dark blood dripping from our adventurers faces, instead there are a lot of light jokes and quite positive chit-chat really, considering the situation the characters are in. The dialogue so far hasn\u0026rsquo;t been amazing, but it\u0026rsquo;s entertaining and enjoyable, and dare I say - fun. The tone is nothing like wading through the serious darkness that is \u0026lsquo;Elden Ring\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Dark Souls\u0026rsquo;. I would compare it more to the dialogue in Neverwinter Nights II, which is one of my favourite games, although it doesn\u0026rsquo;t appear to be as good as the dialogue in that game. Actually, there are a lot of negatives in my work and personal life at the moment - so I\u0026rsquo;m absolutely enjoying a light-hearted adventure with the camaraderie and banter that I found mysteriously absent in Baldur\u0026rsquo;s Gate 3. The graphics are amazing. Playing in Ultra settings on my 1440p HDR monitor in a dark room is epic. The audio is great. There is a \u0026lsquo;dynamic range\u0026rsquo; setting so that you can make the most of high end audio equipment, which I\u0026rsquo;m lucky enough to have, and a 3D audio setting for headphones. Gamers moan at BioWare for being \u0026lsquo;woke\u0026rsquo; - but as a fully card-carrying member of the \u0026lsquo;woke\u0026rsquo; club myself, I see this as a benefit rather than a drawback. More to come as I get more into the game.\n","permalink":"https://davidcraddock.games/dragon-age-veilguard/","summary":"I pre-ordered Dragon Age: Veilguard, and started playing it as soon as it downloaded after release.\nFirst impressions?
