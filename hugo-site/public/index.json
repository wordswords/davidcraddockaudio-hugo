[{"content":"I have recently been donating equipment and tech help to Mark Chalmers Twitch.TV DJ streams, Heavy Resistance Aberdeen and Disintegrate at Midnight Aberdeen. I have also been DJing regularly on these streams.\nI donated a large amount of my old DJ setup to Mark, because I wanted it to go to a good home. This helped Mark to build quite an impressive DJ setup in his small flat.\nI worked with him solving many IT support issues with his DJ laptop and streaming laptop, and other elements of his A/V setup, making sure that everything was configured in an optimal way for streaming and DJing.\nWith Mark I spent a lot of time establishing a working consistent reliable Twitch.TV DJ stream through our 5G mobile phones, in the absence of a dedicated broadband connection in his flat. This was no small undertaking, given the limitations of available 5G bandwidth in Salford City Centre, latency problems with 5G, and the number of devices we were using that required reliable internet access as part of the stream. It involved configuring everything to use as little bandwidth as possible, monitoring the connection extensively, and sharing the connection through a mobile router using USB tethering on the 5G device.\nI used GenAI agents to process a large number of Mark\u0026rsquo;s previous set playlists, and order the tracks mentioned in order of frequency played, and created a TIDAL DJ streaming playlist that was easily accessible when DJing of all the tracks, sorted in frequency order. This allows for quick and easy access to the regular \u0026lsquo;floorfillers\u0026rsquo; at a moments notice.\nI DJ\u0026rsquo;d as a guest DJ on the stream, receiving positive feedback for my track selection and mixing, and contributed towards the entertainment and general debauchery of the stream.\n","permalink":"https://davidcraddockaudio.com/work-with-mark-chalmers/","summary":"I have recently been donating equipment and tech help to Mark Chalmers Twitch.TV DJ streams, Heavy Resistance Aberdeen and Disintegrate at Midnight Aberdeen.
