      <description>I have recently been donating equipment and tech help to Mark Chalmers Twitch.TV DJ streams, Heavy Resistance Aberdeen and Disintegrate at Midnight Aberdeen. I have also been DJing regularly on these streams.
I donated a large amount of my old DJ setup to Mark, because I wanted it to go to a good home. This helped Mark to build quite an impressive DJ setup in his small flat.
I worked with him solving many IT support issues with his DJ laptop and streaming laptop, and other elements of his A/V setup, making sure that everything was configured in an optimal way for streaming and DJing.</description>

      <description>Music Education In tandem with decades of professional experience in DJing and production, I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer in life-long music education, and have complimented my music work with a lot of formal and informal music education:
I have studied 5 modules in music production and sound engineering focused on DJing and electronic music, one at [https://www.canterburycollege.ac.uk](Canterbury College), one at Manchester School of Electronic Music Manchester, and three of which have been at: https://www.</description>

      <description>I have a strong music and sound engineering technical element to my skillset, having built several novel DJ set-ups, several music studio builds, including dealing with acoustic challenges, digital streaming challenges, and have built my own modular synthesisers which included extensive research.
My career in IT, software and as a technologist heavily intersects with this, for example: I spent 6 months in BBC R&amp;amp;D&amp;rsquo;s music department working on modelling binaural acoustic research algorithms.</description>
