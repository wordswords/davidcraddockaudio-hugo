      <description>I have recently been donating equipment and tech help to Mark Chalmers Twitch.TV DJ streams, Heavy Resistance Aberdeen and Disintegrate at Midnight Aberdeen. I have also been DJing regularly on these streams.
I donated a large amount of my old DJ setup to Mark, because I wanted it to go to a good home. This helped Mark to build quite an impressive DJ setup in his small flat.
I worked with him solving many IT support issues with his DJ laptop and streaming laptop, and other elements of his A/V setup, making sure that everything was configured in an optimal way for streaming and DJing.</description>
