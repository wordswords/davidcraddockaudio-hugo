      <description>I played through the version of [https://store.steampowered.com/app/2023000/Batsugun/](Batsugun on Steam) on the arcade setup.
It is part of the [Toaplan Arcade Shoot ‘Em Up Collection Vol.4](Toaplan Arcade Shoot &amp;lsquo;Em Up Collection Vol.4).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted an arcade machine in my home. But I could never really afford one, in terms of time and space.
Recently I thought to myself, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m 42, I&amp;rsquo;m not getting any younger&amp;rdquo;. So I built an arcade setup using the things I already had in the home.
Games The ROMs I have are all stored on my file server upstairs. I can get around a 3gbits/sec connection via my 10gbits/sec home network, so there is no performance &amp;lsquo;hit&amp;rsquo; in streaming them off the network drive - it has similar speed and latency to a physical drive.</description>

      <title>Gunstar Heroes Review</title>

      <description>For years I have been stuck with a working megadrive with a Gunstar Heroes cartridge that works UP UNTIL A POINT, and then crashes.
If it were fully working, this Gunstar Heroes megadrive cartridge would be worth £250 at least at Ebay current prices!
But more annoyingly, I have not been able to play the game properly.
When Sega decided to discontinue the Sega Megadrive Collection on Steam, they offered a low price to buy all of the games, one of which was - you guessed it, Gunstar Heroes.</description>

      <description>This is my new gaming blog, where I will write reviews of games I&amp;rsquo;ve played, game accessories I&amp;rsquo;ve bought, and anything else PC or console gaming-related that I can think of.
It is using the same setup as my main https://davidcraddock.net blog - as in - it&amp;rsquo;s self-hosted, and uses the Hugo Go-based static blogging engine.</description>

      <description>Time Crisis 2 is a light-gun shooter arcade game developed and published by Namco. It was released in arcades in 1997, and later ported to the PlayStation 2 in 2001. It is the second instalment in the Time Crisis series.
The game features a two-player mode, where each player takes turns using a light gun to shoot enemies and reload. Players can duck behind cover to avoid enemy fire, and pop out to shoot enemies.</description>

      <title>Dragon Age: Veilguard - First Impressions</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/dragon-age-veilguard/</link>

      <description>I pre-ordered Dragon Age: Veilguard, and started playing it as soon as it downloaded after release.
First impressions? Quite positive! Some initial thoughts:
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a long-time BioWare fan since Baldur&amp;rsquo;s Gate, but was massively disappointed with Mass Effect: Andromeda, so much so that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even bother playing Anthem. I do like the setting and the characterisations in the Dragon Age series, and thought it was worth pre-ordering this game just in case they didn&amp;rsquo;t totally mess it up.</description>
